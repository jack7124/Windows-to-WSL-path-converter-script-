# Windows-to-WSL-path-converter-script-
Bash script for converting Windows path addresses to WSL /mnt paths. I created this for my Bioinformatics class after realizing a common workflow roadblock: manually typing in /mnt pathways when windows copies their path addresses in their own format. WSL is not able to cd to windows paths, only /mnt pathways, so you cannot copy a window's path from documents or some other folder and paste that path into a CD command. The simple script, when called, echo's the /mnt path from the windows path address. From there, the user can simply copy the echo'd path and paste that into a CD command.
