# Windows-to-WSL-path-converter-script-
Bash script for converting Windows path addresses to WSL /mnt paths. I created this for my Bioinformatics class after realizing a common workflow roadblock: manually typing in /mnt pathways when windows copies their path addresses in their own format. The simple script, when called, echo's the /mnt path from the windows path address.
