# OPTIONAL: Automate usage so that the converted path is auto changed into once path is provided, one command
# Manual validation is still usable using the example command block above
# DO NOT USE BEFORE FINISHING SET UP IN how_to_use.txt.
# This is only copied and pasted from that file
#^^^^^^^^^^^^^
## Creating a cd function in bash.rc
## 1. open bash.rc using nano
###     A. nano ~/.bashrc

## 2. Add the following function to the bottom of the file BELOW the export path line we added earlier

# wcd is the name of our shell function we're creating
wcd() {
  # This tests if the length is zero using -z. That tests our first arg, the Windows path
  if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Error: Please provide a Windows path in quotes."
  else
    # Run your script and capture its output
    # Local declares wsl_path as only accessible in this function
    # $(...) This runs the interior () command and uses it as output for the wsl_path variable
    local wsl_path=$(convert_W_path.sh "$1")
    # Change directory to the converted path
    cd "$wsl_path"
  fi
}

## usage: wcd "C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Documents\cool_repo"
## Result: you are put into the directory.
### Why use this: The manual validation requires three distinct actions:
        # 1. Use the .sh command to echo the /mnt path
        # 2. copy the echo'd path
        # 3. cd into the echo'd path directory
### This automated command is all in one. You simply copy and paste the path, then you are automatically routed into that directory's path

# This does NOT make new directories, it only combines the manual validation functions to route into the same /mnt path.
# Reminder that manual validation is still able to be used even if you create this wcd command!

# Enjoy some workflow efficiency :)
