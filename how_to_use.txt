# This is an explanation file for using my convert_w_path script.



# First off, do not run the script first. You need to change some 
# file permissions and update the location of the command. 


# 1. Make the script executable 
## 	1. To do this, you will use chmod +x. Chmod changes file permissions and +x adds the executable permission.
##      2. chmod +x convert_W_path.sh 



# 2. Add to system PATH to allow global use 
## 	1. Move your script to the bin directory
##	  A. If you don't have a bin directory, make one in your home directory
##          * cd ~
##	    * mkdir -p ~/bin
## 	  B. mv convert_W_path.sh ~/bin



# 3. Add ~/bin to the PATH environment variable, bashrc
##	1. Echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc


# 4. Reload bashrc to apply changes to current terminal session
##	1. source ~/.bashrc

# Now you can run convert_w_path.sh in any directory.
# The final output after running the script should be an echo of the /mnt path which WSL finds friendly.
